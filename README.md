# Blender_Reacle
## Introduction
  An open-source DEM simulation system named ***REACLE*** for granular materials, is a fork of open-source impulse-based physics engine [**Bullet**](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3), which is carried out on open-source 3D creation suite [**Blender**](https://github.com/sobotka/blender) platform
  
  The main features are: 
  
  a). The frictional contacts and binary collision of arbitrarily shaped particles are unified in one linear complementarity problem.
  
  b). **The real-time AABB Tree of contact detection on broad phase is improved with mirror-enhanced algorithm.** 
  
  c). **Multiple data-operation system is improved with Python API including velocity, force, location, orientation and contact number.**
  
  d). Advanced computer technologies are adopted for fast and stable simulation, for example, CPU Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SS2) for core dynamics computation and GPU compute unified device architecture (CUDA 8.0) for 3D creating and rendering.
